      <h2>ZEN Of Python</h2>
      <p>If you wanna know about the core of Python, write in a new file of python <i>import this</i></p>
      <p>When you excecute this library you can view the rules to became python a language special. You can view this
        below:</p>

      <pre><code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
1.Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.Explicit is better than implicit.
3.Simple is better than complex.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9.Although practicality beats purity.
10.Errors should never pass silently.
11.Unless explicitly silenced.
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15.Now is better than never.
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
17.If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!.

      <h2>Python Basics — A Friendly Conversation</h2>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Hey man, I just opened Python... what’s the first thing I should know?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Easy. Think of variables as boxes. You put stuff inside them. Numbers, text, whatever.
      </p>

      <pre><code>name = "Alex"        # This is a string
age = 22             # This is number integer
is_cool = True       # This is a boolean
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh, like labeling containers in my house?</p>
      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Exactly. Your brain got it before I finished the sentence.</p>

      <h3>Control Structures</h3>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And how do I tell Python to make decisions?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Same way you decide every day:</p>

      <pre><code>if age > 18:
    print("Welcome, adult!")
else:
    print("Sorry, kiddo!")
</code></pre>

      <h3>Data Structures</h3>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Now imagine you want to store multiple things.
        Lists are like backpacks. <strong>Dictionaries</strong> are like labeled drawers.</p>

      <pre><code>backpack = ["water", "notebook", "pencil"]
drawer = {"name": "Alex", "age": 22}
</code></pre>

      <h3>Working with Numbers</h3>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> So, what about numbers in Python? Are they complicated?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Not at all. Python handles numbers like a pro.
        You’ve got three main types: integers, floats and complex numbers.
        But honestly, 99% of the time you'll use the first two.</p>

      <pre><code>age = 25            # integer
height = 1.82       # float
result = age + 10   # simple math
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And Python understands math just like me?</p>
      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Hopefully better than you on a Monday morning.</p>

      <h3>While Loops</h3>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> I’ve heard about loops… like repeating stuff?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Exactly. A <strong>while</strong> loop repeats as long as a condition is true.
        It’s like checking your phone every minute waiting for a message.</p>

      <pre><code>count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Waiting...")
    count += 1
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> So it stops when <strong>count</strong> reaches 3?</p>
      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yep. When the condition becomes false, the loop ends.</p>

      <h3>For Loops (Searching for something)</h3>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And the <strong>for</strong> loop?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> The <strong>for</strong> loop is perfect for going through lists, strings, or any
        group of items.</p>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Can you give me a real example?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Sure. Let’s say you want to check if a list of products contains something.
        Even partial matches. Super useful in real life.</p>

      <pre><code>products = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple", "grape"]
search = "app"
found = []

for item in products:
    if search.lower() in item.lower():
        found.append(item)

if found:
    print("Matches found:", found)
else:
    print("No matches found.")
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Wait… so if I search “app”, it finds “apple” AND “pineapple”?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Exactly. That’s partial matching.
        Python checks if the word <strong>app</strong> exists inside each product name.</p>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Damn, that’s actually useful.</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Welcome to Python, buddy.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="oop" id="oop">
      <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Dude… everyone keeps saying “you need to learn <strong>OOP</strong>”.
        Why? What’s the big deal?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Relax man. <strong>OOP</strong> is just a way to organize your code like real life.
        Think about your daily stuff — your phone, your backpack, your cat.
        Each one is an object with things it “has” and things it “does”.</p>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> So Python tries to copy that?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Exactly. In Python you create your own objects using <strong>classes</strong>.
        Let me show you something simple…</p>

      <h3>A Basic Class</h3>

      <pre><code>class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hey, I'm {self.name}!")

player = Player("Alex", 100)
player.greet()
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Ohh, so <strong>__init__</strong> is like the birth moment of the object?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yup. Baby Player is born with a name and health.</p>

      <h3>Adding Behavior <strong>(Methods)</strong></h3>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Let’s give the player an action.
        Like taking damage — everyday stuff, right?</p>

      <pre><code>class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health

    def take_damage(self, amount):
        self.health -= amount
        print(f"{self.name} took {amount} damage! Health is now {self.health}.")
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Nice, now it feels like a game character.</p>

      <h3>Now let’s add a Simple <strong>Algorithm</strong></h3>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> And… <strong>algorithms</strong>? Can we mix one in there?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Sure. Let’s say the player has an inventory and
        we want to check if an item exists. That's just a simple search <strong>algorithm</strong>.</p>

      <pre><code>class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.inventory = ["sword", "shield", "apple", "potion"]

    def has_item(self, item):
        # Simple search algorithm (linear search)
        for obj in self.inventory:
            if obj == item:
                return True
        return False

player = Player("Alex")

print(player.has_item("apple"))   # True
print(player.has_item("banana"))  # False (sad fruit noises)
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> So that loop checking items one by one… that’s an <strong>algorithm</strong>?</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yep. The simplest one.
        Also, 80% of beginners' LeetCode solutions start exactly like this.</p>

      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Bro… I feel powerful.</p>

      <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Congratulations, you now officially understand <strong>OOP and Algorithms</strong>.
        Your ancestors are proud.</p>
